We assume that ALE is already set up so our source code doesn't come with ALE. Also, it doesn't provide ROM.

Compilation:
Before run make command, make sure you set the path to ALE right in the Makefile

Usage:
./Agent <option> <path to ROM>

Options:
-t: Test mode. No learning would be done. Weights will be loaded from file. Default is traning mode
-e: Setting number of episodes to run. Default is 10
